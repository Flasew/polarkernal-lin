[DESCRIPTION]
=============
TODO: I'll finish this file after testing... Especially when I'm not sure
which branch (which are not created yet) will provide the best performance.

Current implementation uses workqueue and normal work

I'll have a "workdelay" to test performance on delayed work struct and
another "kthread" branch to test performance on plain kernel thread.

More intensive testing is also needed for these code.

TODO: I may consider put the current Gih python class into a module.
